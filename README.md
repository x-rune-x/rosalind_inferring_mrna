# rosalind_inferring_mrna
Calculates the number of possible mRNA sequences that could result in a given amino acid sequence when translated.

This is a solution to the Inferring mRNA from Protein (ID = MRNA) problem on the bioinformatics website Rosalind.

The program takes a text file with a sequence of amino acids and returns the number of possible mRNA sequences that could result in the given amino acid sequence following translation.

To avoid dealing with very large numbers, the answer is provided modulo 1000000.
